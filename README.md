This repository combines two IoT-based access control projects:

Key Management System – Secure storage, tracking, and management of keys using custom PCBs and ESP-NOW communication.

IoT Door System – Local Flask server integration for controlling and monitoring doors, with OTA update support and MAC address-based access validation.

Features

Custom PCB Designs for Key Management System hardware.

ESP-NOW Communication for low-latency device networking.

Local Flask Server for IoT Door System control and monitoring.

MAC Address Authentication to restrict unauthorized access.

OTA Firmware Updates to remotely upgrade device software.

Arduino IDE Source Codes for all firmware.

Technologies Used

Arduino IDE – Firmware development

ESP-NOW Protocol – Peer-to-peer ESP communication

Flask – Local web server for control and monitoring

OTA Updates – Remote firmware management

PCB Design Tools – Hardware design for Key Management System
